# Machine_Learning_Models

# 🚀 Machine Learning Models using opps

I have implemented *multiple Machine Learning algorithms* using two different approaches:  
✅ *From Scratch with Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs)* – To understand the core logic behind ML models.  
✅ *Using Scikit-Learn* – To compare performance with optimized library implementations.  

## 📌 Implemented Models

### 🛠 Built from Scratch (OOPs)
- 🌳 *Decision Tree*  
- 📈 *Linear Regression*  
- 🔄 *Logistic Regression*  

### ⚡ Built with Scikit-Learn
- 🌳 *Decision Tree*  
- 📈 *Linear Regression*  
- 🔄 *Logistic Regression*  
- 🎯 *K-Mean cluster (KMC)*  
- 📉 *Naïve Bayes*
